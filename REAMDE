Installing Tub
==============

On account of being so kickass, Tub is written in Rust, which you can install
from here:

    https://rustup.rs/

Then build and install Tub like this:

    $ cargo install --path .

The `tub` CLI tool is our current toy version control software.

Initialize a Tub and import some objects (files) like this:

    $ tub init
    $ tub import /usr/share/doc

Then you can check what is now in your Tub:

    $ tub list-objects
    $ tub stats


WTF is Tub?  A database, version control software, or what?
===========================================================

The goal of Tub is to improve the operational efficiency of complex human
systems (companies, governments, nonprofits, etc).  Go faster, solve harder
problems, make the wold a better place... that kinda stuff.

Tub is made for ALL of your data.  From source code to raw video files to
structured data.  The way Tub can improve operational efficiency is by unifying
all your data into a single, coherent system.
