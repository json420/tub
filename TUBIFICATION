    tub·i·fi·ca·tion

    /tʌbəfəˈkāSH(ə)n/

noun: tubification; plural noun: tubifications 

    1.  The process of migrating from legacy data stores and tooling within an
        organization to a hyper modern, unified data system called Bathtub DB
        (or Tub for short).

    2.  Early 21st century software design trend during which content
        addressable storage became like way more awesome and stuff; sometimes
        called Gitification, in reference to Tub's predecessor, Git.

The goal of Tub isn't to replace Git.  The goal of Tub is to bring Git-like
technology into every last market corner where Git-like technology can and
should be used but isn't yet being used.  And to replace Git.
